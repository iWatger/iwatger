# Hi, my name is Ethan Fox

I am an undergraduate student at the College of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, and I am from rural North Georgia. 

## Current Areas of Focus 
Just a list of stuff that have been in my life recently 

### Teaching Assistant
I currently work with the College of Computing at Georgia Tech as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms class. 

### iOS Club
I am a senior developer at the Georgia Tech iOS Club. Last year, I worked with a team and we created a game called Musicle! It won first place in the Spring 2022 iOS Club Demo Day. It was a great opportunity to learn more about Swift and developing for Apple platforms. This year I hope to go even farther and learn even more.

## Interests
I find design really interesting. I am currently pursuing a minor in Industrial Design. I love getting to read about the design process. Some books I've found really insightful have been *After Steve* and *The Collected Angers*.
